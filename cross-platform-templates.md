# JWT vs Sessions: A Software Engineer's Practical Guide

As a Software Engineer at Aarogya ID working on India's national health registries, authentication security isn't just important—it's critical for millions of users' data.

I've implemented both JWT and session-based authentication in production systems, and I frequently get asked: "Which one should I use?"

Here's my practical framework based on real-world experience:

## The Quick Decision Framework

**Building a traditional web app?** → Sessions are your friend
**Building an API or SPA?** → JWT will serve you better
**Under 1000 users?** → Either works fine
**Scaling to thousands?** → JWT wins on simplicity

[Key excerpts from your blog post]

## Real-World Experience

At Aarogya ID, we've used both approaches:

- **Sessions** for our admin dashboard (better for server-side rendered pages)
- **JWT** for our mobile API (stateless and scales better)

Both work great when implemented correctly. The key is understanding your specific use case.

## Read the Complete Guide

I've written a comprehensive technical guide with code examples and implementation details. Check it out:

👉 **[Complete JWT vs Sessions Guide](https://www.kripanshu.me/blog/posts/jwt-vs-sessions/)**

The guide includes:
✅ Real code examples
✅ Security best practices  
✅ Performance comparisons
✅ Decision framework

🧵 THREAD: JWT vs Sessions - Which authentication method should you choose?

As a Software Engineer @AarogyaID, I've built apps with both. Here's my practical guide:

1/8

🎯 The Quick Decision:

Traditional web app with forms? → Sessions
API or React/Vue app? → JWT
Under 1K users? → Either works
1K+ users? → JWT scales easier
Banking/medical data? → Sessions safer

2/8

🍪 Sessions = Hotel Key Card System

You get a simple card → Hotel keeps all your info in their system → Security checks the card number

Pros: Easy to revoke, server controls everything
Cons: Needs server storage, doesn't scale easily

3/8

🎫 JWT = VIP Concert Pass

All your info is ON the pass → Security scans the pass → No database lookup needed

Pros: Stateless, scales great, perfect for APIs
Cons: Hard to revoke, tokens can get large

4/8

💡 Real-world at @AarogyaID:

We use BOTH:
- Sessions for admin dashboard (server-side rendered)
- JWT for mobile API (stateless, millions of users)

The "right" choice depends on what you're building!
