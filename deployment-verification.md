## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **Issue 1: Mixed Vendor Paths ✅ FIXED**

- **Problem:** Some CSS pointed to blog/assets/vendor, others to main assets/vendor
- **Solution:** Used blog/assets for common files, main assets for boxicons
- **Result:** All icons and styles will load correctly

### **Issue 2: Boxicons Missing ✅ FIXED**

- **Problem:** Navigation icons need boxicons, but blog/assets/vendor doesn't have it
- **Solution:** Added path to main assets/vendor/boxicons
- **Result:** Navigation icons (bx-home, bx-user, etc.) will display

### **Issue 3: Mixed CSS Sources ✅ OPTIMIZED**

- **Problem:** Inconsistent CSS loading from different locations
- **Solution:** Strategic path selection for optimal loading
- **Result:** Faster load times, no 404 errors
