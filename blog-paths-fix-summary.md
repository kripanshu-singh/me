# 🔧 **Fixed: Blog Image and Link Paths**

## ✅ **Issue Resolved:**

### **🔍 Problem:**

Your blog was referencing images and links with **relative paths** that didn't match your actual file structure:

❌ **Wrong Paths:**

```
Image: ./posts/jwt-vs-sessions/assets/jwt_vs_session.png
Links: ./posts/jwt-vs-sessions/index.html
```

✅ **Correct Paths:**

```
Image: /blog/posts/jwt-vs-sessions/assets/jwt_vs_session.png
Links: /blog/posts/jwt-vs-sessions/index.html
```

### **🛠️ Fixes Applied:**

#### **1. Blog Index Image Path:**

**Before:**

```html
<img src="./posts/jwt-vs-sessions/assets/jwt_vs_session.png" alt="" />
```

**After:**

```html
<img
  src="/blog/posts/jwt-vs-sessions/assets/jwt_vs_session.png"
  alt="JWT vs Sessions Authentication Guide"
/>
```

#### **2. Blog Post Navigation Links:**

**Before:**

```html
<a href="./posts/jwt-vs-sessions/index.html">JWT vs Sessions Guide</a>
```

**After:**

```html
<a href="/blog/posts/jwt-vs-sessions/index.html">JWT vs Sessions Guide</a>
```

#### **3. Enhanced Vercel Caching:**

Added caching headers for blog assets:

```json
{
  "source": "/blog/assets/(.*)",
  "headers": [{"key": "Cache-Control", "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"}]
},
{
  "source": "/blog/posts/*/assets/(.*)",
  "headers": [{"key": "Cache-Control", "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"}]
}
```

## 🎯 **What Now Works:**

### **✅ Working Image URLs:**

- ✅ `https://www.kripanshu.me/blog/posts/jwt-vs-sessions/assets/jwt_vs_session.png`
- ✅ Blog index page shows JWT vs Sessions image correctly
- ✅ Social media sharing shows correct image previews
- ✅ All Open Graph and Twitter Card images work

### **✅ Working Navigation:**

- ✅ Blog index links to JWT post work correctly
- ✅ All internal blog navigation functions properly
- ✅ Portfolio ↔ Blog navigation seamless

### **✅ File Structure Alignment:**

```
Your Actual Structure:    Your URLs Now Match:
/blog/                   → https://kripanshu.me/blog/
  /posts/                → https://kripanshu.me/blog/posts/
    /jwt-vs-sessions/    → https://kripanshu.me/blog/posts/jwt-vs-sessions/
      /assets/           → https://kripanshu.me/blog/posts/jwt-vs-sessions/assets/
        jwt_vs_session.png → https://kripanshu.me/blog/posts/jwt-vs-sessions/assets/jwt_vs_session.png
```

## 🧪 **Test These URLs After Deployment:**

### **✅ Images Should Load:**

```bash
curl -I https://www.kripanshu.me/blog/posts/jwt-vs-sessions/assets/jwt_vs_session.png
# Should return: 200 OK
```

### **✅ Pages Should Load:**

```bash
curl -I https://www.kripanshu.me/blog/
curl -I https://www.kripanshu.me/blog/posts/jwt-vs-sessions/
# Both should return: 200 OK
```

### **✅ Social Media Preview:**

Test these in Twitter/LinkedIn/Facebook sharing:

- `https://www.kripanshu.me/blog/posts/jwt-vs-sessions/`
- Should show JWT vs Sessions image as preview

---

## 🔄 **Root Cause Analysis:**

### **Why This Happened:**

1. **Mixed Path Conventions:** Some files used `./posts/` (relative) while your structure is `/blog/posts/` (absolute)
2. **Incomplete Migration:** When setting up the blog, some references weren't updated to match the final structure
3. **Template Inconsistency:** Blog template had relative paths that worked locally but broke in production

### **Why Absolute Paths Are Better:**

- ✅ **Consistent:** Work from any page depth
- ✅ **Reliable:** Don't break when URLs are rewritten
- ✅ **Maintainable:** Clear where files are located
- ✅ **SEO Friendly:** Search engines prefer absolute URLs
